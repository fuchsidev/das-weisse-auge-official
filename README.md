# Introduction
Greetings of The Twelve ðŸ‘‹  
This repo is all about the Discord bot [Das WeiÃŸe Auge Server](http://dasweisseauge.de/) (The White Eye), for the P&P game The Dark Eye aka. Das Schwarze Auge. 

If you need help regarding the bot, feel free to message me on the official [Das WeiÃŸe Auge Discord Server](http://discord.dasweisseauge.de/)!  
If you have Feature Requests, you can either do that on the server, or simply create an Issue in this repo.   
Make sure to checkout existing Issues! Maybe your Feature was already requested before.   

While most of the DSA community is german (myself included), please try to keep this repo english only, to include international players as well :)    
Also, I do most of my coding in english, so its easier for me to manage everything too!  
Speaking of me.. I'm Fuchsi ðŸ‘‹ and I'm the main developer of Das WeiÃŸe Auge.   
Feel free to message me on Discord (Fuchsi#7800), both in private messages as well as on the server :)

Since the issues on this project can range from "Just brainstormed this cool idea" to "pretty much fully developed the feature" I will document what I'm currently working on in this issue, to give users an overview of the current tasks im working on. 
This will not be a daily todo list, but instead is intended to give a general idea of current projects. 

-----

Since DWA recently got verified I'm currently focused on polishing the current features and finishing the last Quality of Life Updates I'd like to have ready for the official release. 
This includes:
- Create a Group Command that lists all active heroes and their current stats (Lp, Fate Points etc.)
- Translate the combat dice tables to english (including focus rules)
- Create a tutorial command that will guide new users through the bot's features and explain how to get started - both for players and game masters.
- If I have time left I'll finish the NPC Generator
